# Sports_Betting_Analysis_Project

**Description**

Sportsbook are a billion Euro business and attract a wide range of people. On the one hand side, there are (semi-)professional gamblers that want to make a fortune based on their expertise in the sports they are betting. On the other hand side, there a dubious actors that are trying to manipulate matches by bribing key actors such as referees, coaches, goalies, etc. This project therefore aims at "solving" both problems at the same time: accurately predicting bets and disclosing suspicious behavior along the temporal dimension. To this end, machine learning / AI methods should be utilized to analyze historical sportsbook data in order to learn and ultimately predict the outcome of matches. For that purpose, historical betting odds should be collected and analyzed, e.g., from:
https://www.oddsportal.com/football/england/premier-league/results/
in order to identify temporal patterns of sport clubs (e.g., Premier League teams) and try to predict the outcome of subsequent matches. Thus, the data needs to be split into training, validation and testing sets. The results should then be assessed to systematically compare the prediction quality of the realized implementation(s). In addition, an alert should be triggered if a potential manipulation pattern has been discovered.

**Objectifs du Projet**

1) creation of a collection from historical results and odds
2) implementation of machine learning /AI methods in order to predict team specific results
3) systematic quality assessment of the realized implementation(s)
4) study of potential manipulation pattern(s)
